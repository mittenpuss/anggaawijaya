Welcome to the GitHub repositories for my personal website! Here you'll find the code and assets that power my website, which showcases my work, skills, and interests. I've designed my website to be responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance, so it should look great and load quickly on a variety of devices and browsers.

You're welcome to browse through my repositories to see how I've built my website, and feel free to use any of the code or assets for your own projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you!!
